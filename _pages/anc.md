I was elected in November 2024 and started my first 2-year term January 2025.

Contact me at: <1c05@anc.dc.gov>

## Accomplishments

- As 1C Treasurer, I've ensured that 1C receives its timely allotments from the DC Government. Before my tenure, 1C was one of the least compliant ANCs in terms of routine filings.
- I drafted, and the Commission passed, [a resolution](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fAcXQBLOigAs5fzPPZXeX0MFrWNO1iCEapy3StQ0nvE/edit?usp=drive_link) encouraging DC Council to make wise choices when developing the RFK Site.

## Wait, what are ANCs?

[ANCs](anc.dc.gov) are DC’s most local form of government. [ANC 1C](https://anc1c.org/) is the [greater Adams Morgan area](https://anc1c.org/index.php/anc1c-meeting/about-us). Single Member District 1C05 is only part of Lanier Heights.

ANCs are liaisons between neighborhood citizens, DC Council and agencies, the Mayor’s office, and some federal agencies. They write non-binding resolutions that are the official voice of the neighborhood, connect constituents with government services, and give small grants.

## Issues

### Pro-transit for higher quality of life

There is a place for all forms of transit in our neighborhood. Personally, I walk to Safeway, ride my bike to the office, ride the bus when it’s rainy, take the Metro to DCA and IAD, and drive my car to visit family in Northern Virginia.

I like city-subsidized parking as much as the next guy, but I would prefer transit and development projects that favor housing and public transit over private vehicle storage.

### Pro-density for better affordability

Economists agree that the way to bring down housing prices overall is to build more housing. And the only way to add more income-restricted, subsidized units is with new development.

I hate construction noise as much as the next guy, but I’d rather support development to produce a vibrant, dense neighborhood with even more places to shop and eat within walking distance.
