I am a team lead in the US CDC's new [**Center for Forecasting and Outbreak
Analytics**](https://www.cdc.gov/forecast-outbreak-analytics/index.html). CFA's
goal is to enable timely, effective decision-making to improve outbreak
response using data, modeling, and analytics.

Outside of work, I am an [Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advisory_Neighborhood_Commission)
for [Commission 1C](https://www.anc1c.org/), representing part of the Lanier
Heights neighborhood. See my [ANC page](/anc/) for more information.

## Work history

My background is in data science and epidemiology, including in infectious
disease, microbiome science, microbiology, antibiotic resistance, statistics,
computing, and mathematical modeling. I have developed skill sets in
facilitation, technical communication, and project management.

During 2021--2022, I was at [**Biobot Analytics**](https://www.biobot.io),
where I built the Epidemiology Group. The goal of that team is to
connect wastewater-based data streams with public health
actions. Biobot performs Covid-19 monitoring for places
like [Boston, MA](https://www.mwra.com/biobot/biobotdata.htm). You can learn more
by watching my [career chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8_Dd8RIKvo)
with [Vivify Space Club](https://www.vivifystem.com/space-club)!

During 2020--2021, I was a part-time Research Analyst at
[**CNA**](https://www.cna.org/), a nonprofit research institute that provides
objective analysis to Federal, state, and local government. At CNA, I helped
advise the US Navy, Federal agencies, and state and city officials, especially
on their Covid-19 responses.

As an independent epidemiological consultant with Dr. [Yonatan
Grad](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/yonatan-grad/), I co-designed a model used
to inform the design of the **National Basketball Association**'s "bubble"
for the 2020 play-offs.

Before Covid-19, I was Scientific Director at
[**OpenBiome**](http://www.openbiome.org), a non-profit stool bank based in
Boston. OpenBiome provides material for fecal microbiota transplantation
(FMT) for use in treating _C. difficile_ infection and for research.

## Educational background

I did my postdoctoral training with [Yonatan
Grad](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/yonatan-grad/) at the Harvard Chan School
of Public Health, where I focused on antimicrobial resistance, and my PhD
with [Eric Alm](http://almlab.mit.edu/) at MIT, where I worked in
environmental microbiology, human microbiome science, and clinical trial
design.

At MIT, I was a founding member of MIT's [Biological Engineering
Communciation Lab](http://bewritinglab.mit.edu/), where I co-led the
development of the first [CommKit](http://mitcommlab.mit.edu/be/), a guide to
communication tasks designed by scientists for scientists. I was also a
founding member of the MIT [Biological Engineering REFS](http://berefs.com/),
a peer-to-peer conflict management and mentoring program, and a Diversity
Chair on the department's graduate student board. During my postdoc I served
as the President of the [Harvard Chan Postdoc
Association](http://hsph.me/pda) and served on the School's Committee for
Diversity and Inclusion.

## Fun

I'm trying to visit all the Japanese gardens in the US. Read about [my progress](japanese-gardens.md).
